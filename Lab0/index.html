        <h2>Graphic Communications</h2>
        <p>My dream job is to make/produce music for a living and travel the world while doing it.</p>
        <h3>Senior</h3>
        <p>I hope to get to a comfortable position with the basics of CSS/HTML. I also want to utilize my graphic design skills and implement them with the skills I learn through this course.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>My favorite things are my laptop, nature, and music. I could listen and deeply analyze music for hours at a time. I love animals, especially my golden retriever Penny.</p>
