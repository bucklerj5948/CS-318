                <p>Palindromes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, in a city buried by ash in that year. This palindrome, 
                    called Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: "Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas" ("The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels"). 
                    It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. 
                    Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or 
                    bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic.<br/><br/> The palindromic Latin riddle "In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni" 
                    ("we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire") describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than 
                    ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled gyrum.</p>
