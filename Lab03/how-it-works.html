        <h2>Controls of the Game</h2>
        <p>What makes Rocket League insanely fun to play is how easy and simplistic the controls are; the
            hard part is actually utilizing the controls in unique and skillful ways in order to create
            that much of a difference when playing another team. Rocket League is a very technical game,
            so while the controls are basic, it's all about how you use them. Here's a button map for
            each console//device to show how Rocket League is played amongst them:
