        <h2>What is Rocket League?</h2>
        <p>Rocket League is a fast-paced competitive videogame available on various platforms such as
            Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The game is equivalent to a quick-paced soccer
            game, but with cars! What better way to waste your time than playing intense matches of car
            soccer?!
        </p>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Each traditional Rocket League match consists of a 5 minute time limit, and allows 2-6 players
            within each game, in either of the three matchup formats: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), and
            Standard (3v3). There is no out of bounds as the entire field is encased in walls and round edges
            connecting to the floor, which allows infinite//limitless gameplay within the playing field.
            The objective of the game is to score more goals than the other team before the timer ends. If
            the time is up and the score is even, the two teams play off in an indefinite overtime that lasts
            until the next goal, in which the next goal wins.
        </p>
        <h2>Playlists</h2>
        <p>Within the game of Rocket League, there are two main playlists that are played amongst the
            majority of players; Casual and Competitive. Casual means you are put into matches that are
            for casual play, as there is no competitive rankings at stake. As for competitive, the games
            are no different from casual aside from the fact that they are competitive; competitive ranks are
            at stake, so if you lose//win, you will go down//up in rankings, which determines your actual skill
            within the game, and can be displayed amongst others' ranks from across the world; If you're good
            enough, you can even attend tournaments that reward thousands of dollars to the winning teams! Click
            "Competitive Ranks" in the navigation bar to learn more about the ranks within the game!
