        <h2>CAR MODELS</h2>
        <p>Here will be introduced three of the most used car models within Rocket League amongst
            competitive players from around the world. There are currently a whopping 100+ unique car models within the
            game, but here's where it gets interesting; there are only 6 different types of hitboxes within
            all of these car models. This means there are techincally only 6 truly different cars, otherwise,
            the models could be classified as cosmetic. The hitboxes are only slightly different shape-wise,
            so it doesn't really affect the game too much or how your car interacts with the ball. These
            very slight differences make this game a unique experience across each player, and increases
            the individuality within player styles and how they play the game, and doesn't affect skill to
            a point where it makes much of a difference, if at all, in game.
